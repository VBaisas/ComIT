            <p>Tony Fiacco made it official on Saturday afternoon that he is taking another crack at becoming Regina’s mayor.</p>
            <p>Having previously run in the 2016 municipal election Fiacco said he’s ready for another go after reflecting on what he learned during his previous attempt.</p>
            <p>“It was a learning experience and we’re gong to be working harder,” said Fiacco speaking on Saturday. A main take away from his previous run was the need to be present in the community, meeting voters and attending events.</p>

                <h1>Reopening Canada: Sask. RV sales rebounding, automotive industry ready to bounce back</h1>
                <p>Doug Ferguson didn’t know what to do, who to talk to or where to go next.</p>
                <p>The president and owner of Moose Jaw RV & Marine, Ferguson — like many in the business community — was left reeling in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. He admitted not knowing where to turn.</p>
                <p>“It’s uncharted waters,” Ferguson said. “There’s no book for how to deal with something like that.”</p>
                <p>His business was already coming off a “horrible” 2019, he said. “It was a slow year. I think most people in this industry found the same thing.” Attributing much of the poor sales to the downturn in the oil and gas sectors, boat sales were “slow and depressed.” There was little indication 2020 would be much better, he said.</p>
                <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it seemingly went from bad to much, much worse.</p>
                <p>“There wasn’t anybody coming in the door and the phones weren’t ringing,” he said.</p>
                <p>Ferguson was running the numbers and debating his options. How long could things stay the way they were? Would he shift to a rental business? What about selling off all his inventory? Would he have to resort to even more drastic measures?</p>
