      <h1>Calgary's critters: Rabbit</h1>
      <p>Cottontail rabbits, snowshoe hares, white-tailed jackrabbits (a type of hare) and a variety of domestic rabbit breeds all call our province home. Alberta Parks says wild rabbits are grey to brown all year, while hares are grey to brown in summer and white in winter. Domestic rabbits living in the wild come in a variety of colours and sizes, and are not protected by any of Alberta's wildlife laws.</p>
